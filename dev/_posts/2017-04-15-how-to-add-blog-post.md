### 1. How To Use GIT and Github

referring to [git-scm-website](https://git-scm.com/) `Git` is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. and `GitHub` is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
